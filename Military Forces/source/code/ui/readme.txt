Notes
=====

This is the code for the new UI.DLL/VM.
It is taken from the v1.29h source code.

As of date, the MFQ3 source ode is v1.27g,
the common files required to build the
project have been copied into the UI
directory (in cgame-129h/game_129h dirs)
to avoid messing around with the 1.27g
versions of these files that the other 
projects us.

Mark.
